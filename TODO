This project was originally generated as part of the EcoMo '09 developer
sprint.

* Get train time/price data. The first I can get pan-Europe from
Deutsche Bahn but the latter is harder for UK<->rest of Europe. I'm
considering taking the DB itinerary data, and splitting it into "UK",
"Eurostar" and "rest of Europe" and I can get each of those prices
individually
* Handle multi-transport journeys, and as part of that actually do a
journey from actual train stations and airports as opposed to the
crude hacks right now. Also allows for pan-World travel using planes
for as little as possible
* Possibly prompt people for when they can get the cheap tickets for a
particular future specified journey (specify journey long time in the
future, get an email when cheap tickets go on sale for each step of
the plan). This came out of discussions with other folks a few days
after EcoMo, and more suggestions keep appearing.

Most of this is dependant on my Copious Free Time, so another item
would to persuade others to hack on it!
